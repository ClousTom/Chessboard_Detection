# Chessboard_Detection
The code enables 'smart' chessboard recognition in space, using simple Computer Vision techniques and OpenCV library. There is also a Depht version of the code, which includes the use of an Intel RealSense camera and its Depht feature.

The code was developed starting from the paper "Chess Piece Detection" by Craig Belshe (California Polytechnic State University. 2021): https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/eesp/548/
